                        Our current project is <b><i>HUMAN RESOURCES</i></b>, an OPEN SOURCE isometric(ish) Souls-like game set in an office. 
                        The goal is not only to create our own game, but establish a framework that future devs can easily expand and improve upon. More details can be found in the Dev Log tab! 
                        You can also join our discord or check out our repo to stay up to date on all things maidenless.
